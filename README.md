## Welcome

Phing a PHP project build system or build tool based on Apache Ant. You can do anything with it that you could do with a traditional build system like GNU make, and its use of simple XML build files and extensible PHP "task" classes make it an easy-to-use and highly flexible build framework. Phing Skills’ “Introduction to Phing” course guides you through everything you need to start building your own project in less than an hour.

- **Who is this for**: New Phing users.
- **What you'll learn**: We'll introduce phing, a build file, targets, tasks, and types.
- **What you'll build**: We'll make a short `build.xml` file.
- **Prerequisites**: None. This course is a great introduction for your first day with Phing.
- **How long**: This course takes less than one hour to complete.

In this course, you will:

1. Create a build file
2. Create a "Hello world" project
